# Operating Systems (SO) - Course Overview

Welcome to the Operating Systems (SO) section of this repository! In this section, you'll find an assortment of projects that delve into the essential concepts and techniques covered in the Operating Systems course.

## What is Operating Systems (SO)?

Operating Systems is a pivotal course that introduces you to the fundamentals of computer operating systems. Throughout this course, you will explore topics that form the backbone of how modern computers manage resources and execute programs efficiently.

**Key Concepts Explored:**
- Introduction to the C Programming Language.
- Processes and Threads.
- Process Scheduling and Management.
- Memory Management and Virtual Memory.
- An Introduction to the Linux Operating System.

## 1. Introduction to the C Programming Language

This section provides an introduction to the C programming language, which is widely used in system-level programming. You'll learn the syntax, data types, control structures, and memory management techniques that are essential for programming within an operating system environment.

## 2. Processes and Threads

Processes and threads are fundamental concepts in operating systems. A process is an independent program with its own memory space, while threads are lightweight units of execution within a process. You'll explore how processes and threads are created, managed, and synchronized to achieve concurrent execution.

## 3. Process Scheduling and Management

Efficient process scheduling is critical for system performance. You'll delve into different process scheduling algorithms, such as First-Come, First-Served, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling. These algorithms determine the order in which processes are executed by the CPU.

## 4. Memory Management and Virtual Memory

Memory management is essential for allocating and deallocating memory efficiently. You'll learn about memory hierarchy, memory allocation techniques, and virtual memory systems. Virtual memory allows the execution of processes that are larger than physical memory by swapping data between main memory and secondary storage.

## 5. An Introduction to the Linux Operating System

Linux is a widely used open-source operating system. This section provides an introduction to Linux, including basic command-line operations, file system navigation, and process management using Linux commands.

## What You'll Discover Here

In this branch of the repository, you will encounter a variety of projects that apply the concepts and techniques learned during the Operating Systems course. Each project focuses on a specific aspect within the realm of operating systems, allowing you to witness these concepts in practical applications.

Feel free to explore the projects, examine the source code, and review the accompanying documentation. We hope this section of the repository serves as a valuable resource to enhance your understanding of operating system principles and their applications in computer science.
